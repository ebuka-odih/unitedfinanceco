Legacy has nine full-service offices serving customers in Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Pueblo West, Ca\u00f1on City, Buena Vista, Lamar, and Wiley, Colorado.<\/p>\n<p>INBC is headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and InBank is a full-service commercial bank with $705 million in total assets, $426 million in gross loans and $603 million in deposits as of September 30, 2021. Following the completion of the merger, the combined bank will have approximately $1.2 billion in total assets and serve customers from 19 offices, including 12 full-service offices and two loan production offices in Colorado, and five full-service offices in northern New Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to announce this partnership that expands upon our commitment to serving the Colorado Front Range and northern New Mexico markets by adding new and important growth markets to InBank\u2019s footprint,\u201d said Ed Francis, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer for InBankshares, Corp and InBank. \u201cLegacy brings an experienced team of bankers and has a similar commitment to serving clients to that of InBank. The combination will further leverage our significant investment in people, commercial treasury products, and technology while helping position InBank to be the premier locally-owned commercial bank. Legacy is great fit for us geographically, strategically, financially, and culturally. Both banks share the same values, culture, and commitment to our customers, communities, and associates, which should allow for a smooth integration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur family looks forward to the strategic partnership and success that we believe the combined bank will have moving forward,\u201d said Dave Esgar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer for Legacy Bank. \u201cLegacy Bank has a long-standing history of service excellence and giving back to its communities. InBank is the right partner to extend and build upon this proud history as a locally-managed community bank.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of INBC and Legacy, INBC will issue 3,566,387 shares of INBC common stock and pay $21.25 million in cash to the shareholders of Legacy Bank in the aggregate. Based on INBC\u2019s closing common stock price of $9.75 per share on November 29, 2021, the consideration to be paid by INBC is valued at approximately $56.0 million. The actual value of the consideration to be paid will change due to fluctuations in the price of INBC common stock and is subject to certain potential adjustments as set forth in the merger agreement. Prior to the closing of the transaction, Legacy will distribute to its shareholders other real estate owned (OREO) and other assets, and will pay its shareholders a special cash dividend, the amount of which will depend upon Legacy\u2019s tangible common equity at the closing, net of certain seller-paid transaction expenses.<\/p>\n<p>The Esgar family (Dave Esgar and his sister Janet McClure) will hold a significant stake in INBC post-closing and will receive a board seat on the INBC and InBank boards of directors. Dave Esgar will continue to work with the combined entity to help ensure a smooth and successful transition. Andrew Trainor, Regional President of Legacy Bank, will join the executive team of InBank and help lead a talented group of employees post-closing.<\/p>\n<p>The merger is subject to approval by federal and state bank regulators and the Legacy shareholders and to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2022, with a systems conversion planned for late third quarter of 2022.<\/p>\n<p>INBC anticipates that the transaction will qualify as a tax-free exchange with respect to the stock consideration received by Legacy\u2019s shareholders. INBC expects the transaction to be over 50% accretive to its earnings per share within the first year of combined operations (FY-2023E) with a pro forma return on average assets approaching 1.0%, and a tangible book value earn back of approximately 2.5 years.

Such risks and uncertainties include, among others: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the merger agreement, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company or Legacy, delays in completing the merger, the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the merger) and shareholder approval or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the merger on a timely basis or at all, the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the merger are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where the Company and Legacy do business, the possibility that the merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events, diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities, potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the merger and the Company\u2019s ability to complete the acquisition and integration of Legacy successfully.<\/p>\n<p>All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, Legacy or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.
