The increase over the first quarter of 2020 was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and a reduction in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense. Similarly, the increase over the linked quarter was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and a decrease in provision for loan losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Net interest margin<\/strong>, expressed as net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, was 3.98% during the first quarter of 2021, compared to 4.34% during the first quarter of 2020 and 3.56% during the fourth quarter of 2020.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Net interest income<\/strong> for the quarter was $6.1 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 52.4%, over the same quarter last year, and an increase of $908,000, or 17.4%, over the linked quarter.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest income increased to $6.5 million from $4.7 million during the first quarter of 2020 and $5.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n<ul>\n<li>The increase compared to first quarter of 2020 was primarily the result of increases in loan and investment portfolio volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the earning asset yield.<\/li>\n<li>Increases over the linked quarter were primarily the result of increases in the loan yields as a result of fees on PPP loans as customers were granted loan forgiveness.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Interest expense decreased to $410,000 from $669,000 during the first quarter of 2020 and $421,000 during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n<ul>\n<li>The decrease was primarily the result of the Company\u2019s cost of funds decreasing to 0.30% during the first quarter of 2021, from 0.35% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and compared to 0.83% during the first quarter of 2021.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Noninterest income<\/strong> for the quarter was $568,000, a decrease of $224,000, or 28.3%, over the same quarter last year, and a decrease of $483,000, or 46.0%, over the linked quarter. The current quarter did not have any realized gains on sale of investment securities, compared to sales gains of $350,000 during the first quarter of 2020 and sales gains of $612,000 during the linked fourth quarter of 2020.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Noninterest expense<\/strong> increased 24.1% to $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $4.6 million for the first quarter of 2020, and was up $89,000, or 1.6% on a linked quarter basis.\u00a0 This was mostly due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits as we continued to hire and invest in new personnel to support our growth plans.<\/p>\n<h4>Balance Sheet Summary<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Total assets<\/strong> were $698.1 million at March 31, 2021, an increase of $89.3 million or 14.7% from $608.7 million at year end 2020. The increase was primarily a result of a $26.8 million increase in total loans, and an increase of $44.5 million in investment securities and of $20.7 million in cash and equivalents, which were funded by growth in deposits. Investment securities were $172.6 million and total cash and equivalents were $60.0 million at March 31, 2021, which combined represented 33.3% of total assets.
