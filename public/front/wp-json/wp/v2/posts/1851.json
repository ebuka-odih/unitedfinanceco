Legacy operates nine full-service offices serving customers in Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Pueblo West, Ca\u00f1on City, Buena Vista, Lamar, and Wiley, Colorado. With the addition of Legacy, on a pro forma combined basis, INBC would have total assets of approximately $1.2 billion, gross loans of approximately $787 million and total deposits of approximately $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022. The combined bank will serve customers from 19 offices, including 12 full-service offices and two loan production offices in Colorado, and five full-service offices in northern New Mexico. Legacy\u2019s systems conversion is planned for the third quarter of 2022. Until the systems conversion is complete, the former Legacy branches will operate under the \u201cLegacy Bank, a Division of InBank\u201d brand. Legacy customers will be notified about the official name change to InBank in the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe would like to welcome Legacy\u2019s customers, associates and shareholders to InBank and InBankshares, Corp. The merger of InBank and Legacy Bank is an extremely exciting opportunity for our two organizations,\u201d said Ed Francis, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer for InBankshares, Corp and InBank. \u201cThe partnership between our banks will allow us to expand the InBank footprint, technology capabilities, product and service delivery, and our commitment to our customers and communities. Our teams are working hard behind the scenes to combine operating systems and planning for a brand transition as Legacy Bank adopts the InBank name at the completion of the conversion process scheduled for the third quarter. We are confident that this transaction will position InBank for significant growth across the Front Range of Colorado with the potential to gain substantial scale, while increasing our market capitalization and improving our earnings power.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLegacy Bank has always been committed to our community, customers and associates,\u201d commented Andrew Trainor, formerly Legacy\u2019s Regional President, now InBank\u2019s President-Community Banking. \u201cWe feel confident that we have found a partner that shares a similar culture, and we are excited to help execute on InBank\u2019s strategy together. Our customers will receive the same great personal service from the same team of associates, paired with additional products, new technology offerings, and an expanded geographic footprint with more branch offices.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>About InBankshares, Corp<\/h4>\n<p>InBankshares, Corp is the holding company for InBank, an independent commercial bank serving the Colorado Front Range, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico markets.
