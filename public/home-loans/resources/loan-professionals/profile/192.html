I was looking for a VA loan for a new construction home and shopping lenders.  I quickly narrowed down my decision to Andy at NBKC bank after the pre-qualification process with all considered lenders and here is why:  Andy was 100% transparent from the onset, which I unfortunately cannot say for the other lenders.  Andy was extremely helpful and responsive throughout the process.  He was extremely efficient and very personable.  I did not feel like just a &quot;number&quot; at any time.  We worked together for a good 4 months and if I had a question, I would text call or email and always received a timely response with an answer or an explanation of how a process worked or why something in the process was required.  I did not experience any stress or pressure while working with Andy which I had already started to feel with other lenders.  Andy made my home loan process a positive experience.  I have and will continue to recommend Andy to friends, family and acquaintances as their Loan Officer.</div>

                                            <div class="team-member-review-content">My wife and I couldn&#039;t be happier with the service we received from Andy during the recent purchase of our home. Between moving across the country with a pregnant wife and starting a new job, we were stressed! Andy was able to make our purchasing process incredibly smooth and was on top of every detail, which is even more impressive considering we needed to close in about 30 days. Even when an issue came up at closing (at the fault of the title company), Andy called me in the meeting and notified me of the problem even before the people at the title company, and we were in the same room! Andy is a true professional and it was a pleasure to have worked with him.</div>

                        <h3>I make an award-winning cherry pie from scratch. As a kid, my grandmother Helen always made me one every time I went to the farm to visit. She never had a recipe written down so when she lost her memory, I lost the best pie ever made. Store pies are awful, so I researched and tried tons of recipes before finally finding one that was close. After a few tweaks I had it and won 2 pie contests with it! I use her old rolling pin when I make the crust. Thanks Grandma!!</h3>
